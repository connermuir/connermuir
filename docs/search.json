Compounding risks facing every ecosystem amplify the need for compelling storytelling ─ through both analysis and art ─ around actions that can be taken to foster reciprocity. As one of my favorite authors Richard Powers writes in The Overstory, “A good answer is worth reinventing from scratch, again and again.” Reinventing our relationship with the natural world may just provide some of the good answers we are in desperate need of.\r\nI believe that building diverse coalitions is the only way to repair fractured relationships with the land. I also believe that this approach presents the opportunity to promote environmental justice in public land and seas management in the United States. In particular, active participation can begin to restore the rights of Native American communities that for centuries have been left out of management decisions and removed from ancestral territory.\r\nAs a Master’s student, I am interested in research using spatial analysis to map wildfire risk, developing ecosystem services frameworks centered around Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and eco-social assessments for climate resilient marine food systems.\r\nExperience (placeholder until CV fixed)\r\nResearcher – Ocean Analytics, Santa Barbara, CA (11/21–Present)\r\nConduct comprehensive analysis of all 46 federally managed fisheries in the United States to develop the first nationwide review of prevailing management strategies\r\nWork directly with NGO partners and fisheries managers to identify key policy developments and assess fishery resilience to climate change\r\nFindings from research will inform a white paper expected to be completed in May 2022\r\nPolicy Analyst – Atlas Public Policy, Remote, SF Bay Area (4/21–6/21)\r\nDirected research, data collection, and writing for two reports funded by a large trade association identifying climate, environmental justice, and economic opportunities of transportation electrification\r\nManaged project proposals for five figure contracts with partners including NGO, government, and private sector entities seeking to develop a living database of climate policies in the U.S.\r\nLeveraged original research and data collection to publish data-based storytelling funded by key players in the electric vehicle (EV) and environmental policy spaces\r\nPolicy Associate – Atlas Public Policy, Remote, SF Bay Area (2/19–4/21)\r\nLed data collection and outreach for the Atlas EV Hub, a subscription-based platform that grew from 500 to more than 1,000 professional users over this time\r\nAssisted with a six figure, government-funded analysis of widespread fleet electrification across all public vehicles in the state of Washington, revealing that the state could cost effectively electrify nearly all vehicles by 2035\r\nPublished more than 10 research papers funded by partnerships with stakeholders in the clean transportation space\r\nProgram Associate – Clinton Foundation, New York, NY (6/17–10/18)\r\nSimulated a country-wide adoption of 100 percent renewable energy in Belize using excel and HOMER software, culminating in several presentations to more than 10 elected officials\r\nConducted research under a $5 million grant with partners at the Rocky Mountain Institute to develop long term clean energy roadmaps for island nations\r\nHelped secure millions of dollars in commitments from Clinton Global Initiative member organizations targeting disaster relief and climate resilience in regions impacted by devastating hurricanes in 2017\r\nPrepared more than 50 research and policy memos for President Clinton and foundation leadership to inform internal policy and data collection across the Foundation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
